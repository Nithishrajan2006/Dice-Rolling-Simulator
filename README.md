Core Logic Steps:

Import the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.

Prompt the user for input (such as how many dice to roll and, optionally, how many sides per die).

Use a function to simulate rolling the dice by generating random integers within the range of possible die values.

Output the results to the user.
