             ðŸŽ² DICE ROLLING SIMULATOR ðŸŽ²
How a Dice Rolling Simulator Works in Python A dice rolling simulator in Python uses the random module's randint() function to generate random numbers that simulate the roll of a die.

Key Steps:

The program imports the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.

When the user wants to "roll" the dice, the program calls random.randint(1, 6). This function returns a random integer between 1 and 6, inclusive, mimicking the possible outcomes of a standard six-sided die.

If rolling multiple dice, the function is called multiple timesâ€”once for each dieâ€”so each die gets its own random result.

The results are then displayed to the user, either as numbers or using ASCII art for a visual effect.
